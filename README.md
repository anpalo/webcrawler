# JS Webcrawler Program

I made this program to:
1. become more comfortable in JavaScript
2. better understand the internal linking structures of websites
3. become acquainted with node.js
4. learn about JS Dependencies and devDependencies

I am completing this program with the guidance of boot.dev.
